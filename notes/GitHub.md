###Course 1: Ruby on Rails: An Introduction

**File Names** should use snake case (lowercase with underscores).

**In comments** there should be space after the # directive.

**Single Quotes ''** should be used till we require String interpolation.

**unless** is used in replacement of if, unless (condition). If the condition is true then do the following.

**until** is used in replacement of while loop, until (condition) will execute till the condition is satisfied.

####Modifier Form
   if, unless, while, until - on the same line as the statement
   
   ```
   a = 5
   b = 0
   
   puts "One liner" if a ==5 and b == 0
   ```
####True/False
Only `false` and `nil` are false

```
0 is true
"false" is true
if "" is true
"nil" is true
if false is false
if nil is false
```
